      ## What Is It Used For?


      An Astral Map lets you select and locate various structures located
      throughout the game. These can include:


      *   Cult Stuctures
          
      *   Ancient Cities
          
      *   Villages
          

      Clicking "SEARCH" applies the coordinates of the structure you selected to
      your TARDIS. Afterwards, you can travel there like usual.  

      If a structure is not available or in search radius of the Astral Map, you
      will receive a 404 warning.


      ## How Do I Craft It?


      An Astral Map is made using the blueprint on the Fabricator.
