      ## What Is It Used For?


      Since we have planets/space now (and you can’t really breathe on them
      forever) we added the Oxygenator. Place it down and in a 16-block radius
      you’ll be able to breathe, have normal gravity in space, and you won’t
      freeze to death, so that’s always a plus!
