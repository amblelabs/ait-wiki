      ## What Is the Fabricator?


      A Fabricator is a machine capable of turning blueprints into usable items.
      Interacting with it while holding a blueprint in your hand will give it a
      recipe, and it will require you to input the items it displays in the
      center.


      **_Do note that required item amounts will vary, and the blueprint will
      not be used up._**


      \* _The Fabricator also acts as a villager workbench, giving the villager
      the job of "Fabricator Engineer", who can provide components and
      blueprints for a small price._


      ## How Do I Get It To Work?


      Look at the tooltip of the blueprint _(hover over it in your inventory)_,
      this will show what item is the blueprint for. This applies to other items
      / blocks in the mod as well, although sometimes you might need to hold the
      Shift Key!

      You won't need JEI, REI, or any other recipe mod for this, as the
      fabricator tells you what items and the amount you need.


      But support for these mods MAY come in the future.
