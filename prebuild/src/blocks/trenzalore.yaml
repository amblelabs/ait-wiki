      **"When the TARDIS is dying, sometimes the dimension dams start breaking
      down. They used to call it a size leak. All the bigger on the inside
      starts leaking to the outside and it grows." - The Eleventh Doctor.**


      A bigger on the inside painting, inspired by the sights of the planet
      [Trenzalore](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Trenzalore) seen in the
      special "[The Name of the
      Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Doctor)".
