      An Interior Detector is used for emitting redstone signals based on
      different states of the TARDIS.

      ## How Do I use the Interior Detector?


      The Interior Detector has 7 modes:


      *   **Orange** (TARDIS is powered on or not)
          
      *   **Green** (TARDIS is crashed or not)
          
      *   **Gray** (TARDIS is locked or not)
          
      *   **White** (The TARDIS doors are open or not)
          
      *   **Blue** (A Sonic Screwdriver is inserted in the Sonic Port of the
      Console or not)
          
      *   **Red** (The Alarms are active or not)
          
      *   **Purple** (The TARDIS is in flight or not)
          

      Right-clicking on the block will cycle through the modes.


      The **Interior Detector Block** has 2 lights. One on the top and one on
      the bottom.  

      The one on the top indicates the mode it's been set to, while the one on
      the bottom indicates if the mode's condition has been met.  

      In the latter case it will also emit a redstone signal.


      You can place the detector on every face of a block, so use it to your
      heart's content.
