      ## How Is It Used?


      The power converter acts as an alternative power source to the Console's
      refueler.  

      It can convert Zeiton Shards, Zeiton Dust, fuel items & blocks (logs,
      coals and lava buckets), as well as the various Coral blocks into Artron
      energy for your TARDIS!  

      Youâ€™ll have to link it up to the Engine via Artron Links (Artron Cables)
      for it to work.
