      ## How Do I Use Them?


      Artron cables used to connect [Generalized Subsystem
      Cores](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/blocks/generalized-subsystem-core/)
      to the TARDIS' engine.  

      You don't need to connect every core separately. If core blocks are
      touching, they can be connected to the engine as one group.
