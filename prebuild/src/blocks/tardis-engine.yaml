      ## Why Is It So Big?


      The Engine is organically based, just like the TARDIS it powers. It will
      grow depending on the amount of components you have connected to it.


      ## How Do I Use It?


      The Engine requires a free 3x3 space to be placed down. Place it anywhere
      inside the TARDIS and attach components to it using [Artron
      Cables](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/blocks/artron_cable/) and
      [Generalized Subsystem
      Cores](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/blocks/generalized_subsystem_core/).


      \* _The engine slowly loses durability when in use. Check out the_
      [_Durability_](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/durability/)
      _page for how to repair it._


      ## How Do I Get It?


      It can be crafted by using an engine blueprint on the **Fabricator** and
      then providing the required materials.
