      ## What does it do?


      The Stattenheim Remote is similar to `TARDIS` mode on the Sonic
      Screwdriver, but this is a bit different, Itâ€™s range is INFINITE. This
      means that with the Stattenheim Remote you can summon the TARDIS to you in
      any dimension and from any distance. Also if you are curious on how long
      your TARDIS is taking, you can see its flight percentage (to do so hover
      over the Stattenheim remote in your inventory and hold `shift` this will
      also let you see if the remote is linked to your TARDIS or not).

      *   First it will need linking to a tardis, this can be done by
      right-clicking the TARDIS Telepathic Circuits found on your console with
      the Stattenheim remote in your main hand.
          
      *   Next; go to where you want your TARDIS to go, look at the specific
      block and press `right-click` (you will hear a sound to indicate your
      tardis is on its way!). **This will not work in the TARDIS dimension**
          
      *   As of 1.2.5.2812 the Stattenheim remote now has durability, remember
      to keep an eye on it when using the remote in your world.
