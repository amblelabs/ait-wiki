      ## The time vortex!


      In the 1.2.0 update we introduced the **_time vortex_** , which is very
      customizable and has data pack support, its behind the door and can be
      viewed by opening the door mid flight, and its bigger on the outside!

      *   Some people have noted that they feel wierd after staring into the
      vortex for prolonged periods of times, but thats probably nothin.
          
      *   It also spins, the higher your throttle speed the faster it spins and
      when you are crashing.
          
      *   Here is a video made by tendo showing the vortex off,how to change it
      and such.
