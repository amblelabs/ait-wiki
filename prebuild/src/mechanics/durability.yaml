      ## WHY MUST YOU DO THIS TO US?


      Yes yes i get it durability might seem scary at first but fear not as our
      durability isn’t a major pain.


      *   Each Subsystem/circuit (including the engine) has a max durability of
      1250.
          
      *   To increase durability simply right click the subsystem/circuit (with
      the listed items at the bottom of the page), this increases the durability
      by 5.
          
      *   Not all subsystems/circuits have durability.
          
      *   Subsystems/circuits do not break when they get to 0 durability,they
      just stop working till you repair them.
          
      *   The only exception for this is the demat circuit which can break due
      to engine phasing.
          

      ## What if I run out of durability?


      Depends, circuits/subsystems won’t break if you run out of durability but
      they’ll malfunction, as an example.


      *   Chameleon circuit will randomize instead of selecting the designated
      exterior.
          
      *   Demat circuit can engine phase if under 300 durability.
          

      ## How do I see durability?


      Sonic in scanning mode.


      ## How does durability go down?


      *   For the engine, durability goes down passively over time.
          
      *   For the other circuits/subsystems that have durability, they’ll go
      down if the system they power is used (example: if you fly with the demat
      circuit the demat circuits durability goes down).
          

      ## How do I increase / fix low durability systems?


      You can `right click` on the block with low durability using; Iron,
      Copper, and Gold to increase the durability / repair it.
