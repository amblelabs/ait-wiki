      ## DEPRECATED


      ~Chameleon exterior also known as adaptive box is a special kind of
      exterior category.~


      ~When activated, it turns into a tree/desert well/chorus plant/giant
      mushroom and etc depending on the biome.~


      ~Due to~ [~the way it was
      implemented~](../../../development/how-it-works/chameleon/) ~it has 2
      qualities:1. It's undetectable. You can't use F3, WAILA or X-ray mods to
      find a disguised TARDIS.2. It's dynamic. It doesn't have any presets,
      therefore it finds the shape to take dynamically. Meaning it works with
      modded (& datapack) biomes.~


      ~To open a camouflaged TARDIS, click the bottom block, where the exterior
      would normally be. Doing that will reveal the capsule.Closing the door
      will camouflage it back.~
