      Chameleon exterior also known as adaptive box is a special kind of
      exterior category.


      When activated, it turns into a tree/desert well/chorus plant/giant
      mushroom and etc depending on the biome.


      Due to the way it was implemented it has 2 qualities:1. It's undetectable.
      You can't use F3, WAILA, Jade or X-ray mods to find a disguised TARDIS. 2.
      It's dynamic. It doesn't have any presets, therefore it finds the shape to
      take dynamically. Meaning it works with modded (& datapack) biomes.


      To open a camouflaged TARDIS, click the bottom block, where the exterior
      would normally be. Doing that will reveal the capsule.Closing the door
      will camouflage it back.


      ## The exterior is extremely useful to hide
