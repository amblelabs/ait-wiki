      ## Fabricating a Sonic Screwdriver


      ![](/mechanics/tardis/images/fabrication.webp)


      To fabricate a Sonic Screwdriver, you'll need to find a blueprint for it;
      these blueprints can be found in all structures. You can see what the
      blueprint is for by holding shift while hovering your mouse over it in
      your inventory. To use the blueprint, you also need a
      [Fabricator](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/blocks/fabricator).
      Fabricators need to be on top of a Smithing Table to work.  

      Now that you have a Fabricator, right-click it with the blueprint for the
      Sonic Screwdriver. This will show all the items needed to fabricate the
      blueprint recipe. Some items needed for the recipe can vary in amount,
      which you can also see in the tooltip. We suggest getting the items about
      now if you haven't already.  

      Once you have all the items needed, right-click the Fabricator while
      holding one of the items and the Fabricator will take it. Once you have
      placed all the items in the Fabricator, it will create the item. You
      simply need to right-click to obtain it.  

      Now that you have a Sonic Screwdriver, we can move on to getting coral
      fragments!


      ## Obtaining a Coral Growth

      Now that you have a Sonic Screwdriver, we can start getting coral
      fragments! Nine coral fragments can used to make a Coral Growth which is
      the key to growing a TARDIS, and is also used for growing a console for
      said TARDIS. You can obtain coral fragments by right-clicking a
      [Rift](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/rift-chunks). A Rift
      is is a crack in time that spawns in rift chunks, which can be found using
      a [Rift
      Scanner](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/rift-chunks).  

      Right-clicking a rift will either give you a coral fragment, paper, or
      place some coral blocks around the rift. If you're holding a sonic
      screwdriver, it will also refill your Sonic's Artron reserve. **Note that
      you will take some damage when you right click a rift. Avoid walking into
      them, too - you'll be flung across time and space!** Once you have nine
      coral fragments, you can craft a Coral Growth by placing all nine of them
      in a crafting table. We recommend getting eighteen fragments while you're
      on the hunt, as you can then craft two Growths; one for the TARDIS, one
      for the console.


      ## Starting TARDIS Growth


      ![](/mechanics/tardis/images/coral-growing.webp)


      Now that you have a Coral Growth, you can start growing it. To start the
      process, you will need to be in a rift chunk, which can be found using the
      [Rift Scanner](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/rift-chunks)
      you used to find the Rifts earlier. It will point in the direction of the
      nearest Rift Chunk. Once you're in a rift chunk, you will need soul sand:
      Growths only grow on soul sand, so place it down and then place the Coral
      Growth on top of it. Overtime, it will start growing!


      At this point, you can now move onto [**Completing Tardis
      Growth.**](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/tardis/completing_tardis_growth)
