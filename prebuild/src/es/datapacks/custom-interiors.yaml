      ## Preview Photo


      *   Using whatever arts and crafts image editor you like (I recommend
      **paint.net** or **Gimp**), create a photo for your desktop in a _SQUARE_
      format.
          
      *   Save this image in the **.png** image format, and with the name of
      your desktop.
          

      If my desktop was called **"war"**, I'd save it as **"war.png"**.


      *   Reuse this desktop name later, as it will also be the ID for your
      desktop.
          

      * * *


      ## Converting Your Beautiful Build To NBT


      Use a **Structure Block** to save your interior.


      First save your interior, and note down your namespace (before the colon)
      and desktop name (after the colon) The _.nbt_ will be saved to
      `.minecraft/saves/(WorldName)/generated/(namespace)/structures`.

      ## Create a Datapack


      *   Follow the tutorial on the [Minecraft Wiki on
      datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) on how to set one up, use
      the namespace from earlier
          
      *   Place the .nbt file from earlier in
          

      `data/(namespace)/structures/interiors/(desktop_name).nbt`


      *   Create a new **.json** file in the path
          

      `data/(namespace)/desktop/(desktop_name).json`


      *   Inside this new .json file, paste
          

      ```

      {
          "id": "namespace:desktop_name"
      }

      ```


      *   replacing the namespace and the **desktop\_name** with your own from
      earlier
          
      *   Now put this **datapack** into Minecraft.
          

      * * *


      ## Create A Resource Pack


      [Follow this
      guide](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Creating_a_resource_pack)


      *   Place your **.png** preview in the path
          

      `assets/(namespace)/textures/desktop/(desktop_name).png`


      *   If you want people to be able to see your preview, they will need this
      **resource pack**.
