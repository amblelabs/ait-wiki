      ## How Does This Work?


      These are used to hold components to be attached to the engine via Artron
      Cables. While holding a component in hand, interact (right-click) with a
      Generalized Subsystem Core to install the component inside it, or sneak +
      interact one a core that already has a component to eject the component
      from it. (Or mine the core to have them both drop together.)
