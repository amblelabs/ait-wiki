      Similar to the show, (using the minecraft chat) Handles can fulfill
      various TARDIS related commands. But firstly, you need to find him. He can
      be found in the Wrecked Cybership structure which spawns in Swamp biomes.
      Once you’ve found him, you’ll need to link him to your TARDIS by placing
      him into the sonic port.

      Once placed into the sonic port, he will be able to accept commands given
      by you. To do so use the in game chat and type “Handles” followed by a
      command you want him to fulfill, Handles will respond with a specific
      message based on what you ask him to do or an error message if you give
      him a wrong command. He will NOT do flight events for you when he’s in the
      Sonic Port!
