      datapacks works! {{< /callout >}}


      When making your own AIT Datapack you may go though some minor problems on
      the way


      ### Common mistakes that people would make


      ## Datapack not enabled


      Once in a while if you don't see your TARDIS in the [TARDIS
      Monitor](../../blocks/monitor) when you are selecting a **Exterior /
      Console Skin** or a **Interior** then it could be that the datapack is not
      enabled in your world. to fix this:


      1.  In chat run the command `/datapack list available`
          

      If you have this problem you may get this responce: ![/datapack list
      available responce](images/bugfixing/listcommandresponse.png)


      If you see your datapack this might be your problem and continue otherwise
      if you don't see this then move onto the next mistake people might make.


      2.  In chat run the command `/datapack enable "file/<your datapack here>"`
          

      After this your datapack should now work if it still doesn't work try to
      reload your world.


      ## Not Reloading Datapack


      When you make changes to your datapack make sure to type `/reload` into
      the chat so that it can apply to the changes you make ingame


      ## Reloading Resourcepacks


      Same as above, when making changes to a resourcepack you need to apply
      that to the game. To do so press `f3+T` keys at the same time on your
      keyboard and it will reload the resourcepack.


      ## Missing textures


      If the texture for something you added is just a pink and black pattern,
      like this.

      Make sure to check the games log (usualy located at `.minecraft/logs` or
      `(minecraft root folder)/logs`, if not google the game launcher or device
      you use as the minecraft game folder location will vary). Then look for
      where the giant wall of text talks about your pack. It should say
      something like `couldn't find texture: (namespace)/texture/...`. If what
      that text says is not where your texture is in the Resourcepack you made,
      you most likly miss-typed the `.png` location inside your datapack so go
      back and double check it!
