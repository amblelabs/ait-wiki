      ## How Do I Use the Redstone Control Block?


      With the Redstone Control Block in your main hand, crouch and click on a
      Console control to set the type of control the block should use.


      *   **Red** = Emulates a left-click on the set control.
          
      *   **Green** = Emulates a right-click on the set control.
          


        
      To toggle the mode, right-click the block.  

      To trigger the control linked to the block, provide redstone power (of any
      level) to the block, e.g. via a button.
