      # What Does It Do?


      The **food replicator** or **food machine** was a device installed in
      TARDISes which produced bars of food. They were engineered to replicate
      meals in flavour and nutrition.  


      This version of the **food machine** can produce 2 variants of the **food
      cube** and can dispense a range of different **drinks** at the cost of
      artron.  


      The first **food cube** is the normal one which just replenishes hunger
      and is called **"Food Cube"**, this one costs 139 artron to produce.
      Secondly is the **"Overcharged Food Cube"** this version costs
      significantly more at 437 artron but is more beneficial to the player as
      it gives the effects: _regeneration, absorption, resistance, fire
      resistance._  


      Moving onto **drinks**, the cost to dispense is at 193 artron, and the
      list of **drinks** we have include _(chocolate milk, coffee, hot cocoa,
      iced coffee, latte, milk, tea, vodka, water)_ but we also have a datapack
      system so you could add your own **drinks**.  


      Because of the machine requiring artron, it is only usable inside the
      TARDIS and requires the TARDIS to be powered on.  


      To use this machine shift right click to cycle through the modes, right
      click to produce your selected item (if you are using the drinks mode, you
      can shift left click to cycle through the different drinks).
