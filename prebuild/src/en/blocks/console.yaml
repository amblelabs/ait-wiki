      The TARDIS console is the main control unit of the TARDIS, which can be
      interacted with by a player or another entity. The TARDIS should always be
      piloted by 6 fully trained TARDIS pilots as to allow for a smooth journey.
      You might notice that it emits a nice ambience, donâ€™t let that distract
      you though.


      Out-of-universe, the console is a collection of **Control Entities** which
      are located around the console block that run different functions.


      ## How Do I Create / Get a Console?

      You could build a Console Generator directly via its recipe, but there is
      an alternative method:  

      Once you have a fully grown TARDIS there will be a Soul Sand block where
      the console should be. Place a Coral Growth on that Soul Sand Block and
      make sure to light up the area. After a while, a console will grow.


      You are provided with one Console Generator when you cache the console.
      But you can build more Console Generators to place multiple consoles in
      your TARDIS.


      Here is the crafting recipe for a Console Generator:

      Place the Console Generator into the TARDIS interior, and you will be able
      to select any of the unlocked consoles. (Or use the "Cache Console" option
      in the monitor of an existing console.)


      To use the Console Generator:


      1.  Right-click or Left-click on the Console Generator to browse through
      the **types** of consoles.
          
      2.  Right-click or Left-click on the Console Generator _while crouching
      with an empty hand_ to browse through the **variants** of the current
      type.
          
      3.  Confirm the console by using a [**Sonic
      Screwdriver**](/items/sonic-screwdriver/) or blaze powder on it.

      ## How Do I Use a TARDIS Console?


      If you're having a hard time finding the controls, you can use the
      **Scanning Mode** of a [**Sonic Screwdriver**](/items/sonic-screwdriver/).
      Alternatively, you can turn on debugging mode for viewing entity
      **hitboxes** by using F3+B (pressing again will turn them off).


      Right or left click on any of the controls to activate them. Certain
      controls - like the **throttle** - need you to crouch to increment (or
      decrement) them fully up or down but will do normal increments when
      freestanding.

      emits a redstone signal if powered is on.
