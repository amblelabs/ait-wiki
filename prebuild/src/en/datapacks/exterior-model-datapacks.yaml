      {{< callout type="warning" >}} You need to learn how texture pack and
      datapacks works! {{< /callout >}}


      ## Create a Datapack


      {{< callout type="info" >}} Follow the tutorial on the [Minecraft Wiki on
      datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) on how to set one up, use
      the namespace from earlier {{< /callout >}}


      Create a new **.json** file in the path


      > `data/(namespace)/exterior/(exterior_name)/(exterior_name).json`

      > 

      > *   This will contain the "code" for the exterior, similar to the old
      AddonExteriors class system.

      >     

      > 

      > Inside this new .json file, paste:

      > 

      > ```json

      > {

      >   "id": "namespace:exterior_name",

      >   "category": "namespace:category_name",

      >   "parent": "ait:exterior/capsule/default",

      >   "texture":
      "namespace:textures/blockentities/exteriors/exterior_name/exterior_name.png",

      >   "emission":
      "namespace:textures/blockentities/exteriors/exterior_name/exterior_name_emission.png",

      >   "model": "namespace:exterior_name",

      >   "door": "namespace:exterior_name_door",

      >   "left_animation": "exterior_name:animation_name",

      >   "right_animation": "exterior_name:animation_name",

      >   "has_transparent_doors": true/false,

      >   "animations": {

      >     "landed": "exterior_name:animation_name",

      >     "demat": "exterior_name:animation_name",

      >     "mat": "exterior_name:animation_name"

      >   },

      > 

      >   "seat_translation": [VALUE,VALUE,VALUE],

      >   "portal_info": {

      >   "enabled": true/false,

      >   "width": VALUE,

      >   "height": VALUE,

      >   "north": [VALUE,VALUE,VALUE],

      >   "north_east": [VALUE,VALUE,VALUE],

      >   "east": [VALUE,VALUE,VALUE],

      >   "south_east": [VALUE,VALUE,VALUE],

      >   "south": [VALUE,VALUE,VALUE],

      *   Make sure you save your files to `assets/(namespace)/bedrock` (you
      `CAN NOT` do sub-folders as the datapack json file only looks for a file
      in the bedrock folder. This means you `CAN NOT` do
      `bedrock/exterior_name/exterior.geo.json` ).
          
      *   For the exterior models, we use bedrock entity models. This is also
      the format you should use to make your models in blockbench! When
      exporting your models as `Bedrock Geometry` and then add `.json` to the
      end of the file name (your model file name should be `model_name.geo.json`
      ). When exporting animations make sure to also add `.json` to the end of
      the file name (your animation file name should be
      `animation_name.animation.json` ).

      ## Explaining everything you can do!


      ### BOTI Portal


      *   For the `portal_info` you will need to manually set its positions and
      scale (FYI: both interior and exterior doors use the same width and
      height) for both the interior AND exterior door. You can also set whether
      the BOTI Portal is always visible or not by setting
      `has_transparent_doors` to `true or false`
          

      ### Custom Animations


      *   You can also add custom `mat, demat, and landed` animations (do be
      aware that they wont override and animations you have selected in the
      monitor, both will run at the same time)
          
      *   Along with exterior animations, you can add custom door animations for
      both doors. This will also determine the amount of doors your exterior
      has. (if you want just 1 door, only make a `left_animation` ).
          

      ### Get your model in game


      *   You can define the exterior and door models by adding your namespace
      and model file name to both the `"model"` and `"door"` sections.
          
      *   To define the texture and emissive textures, add your namespace and
      texture file name to both the`"texture"` and `"emission"` sections (you
      don't have to have an emissive texture if you don't want too but you NEED
      a model texture!).
          
      *   You will need to add your exterior to a category by adding your
      namespace and category name to the`"category"` section so it can be
      selected in the montior, you can use one from ait OR make your own [(SEE
      HOW
      HERE)](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/datapacks/custom-categories/).
          
      *   The parent model is what the exterior will become if it somehow can't
      find your model

      ## Bugs!


      *   This system is still pretty new so will have some issues. If you find
      any please report them [HERE](https://github.com/amblelabs/modkit/issues)
      and NOT on the AIT issues page as datapack exterior models are a part of
      AmbleKit (Our mod library). Also make sure that your issue hasn't been
      reported before!
