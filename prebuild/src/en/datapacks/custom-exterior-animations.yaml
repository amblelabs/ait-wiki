      Create a new **.json** file in the path


      > `data/namespace/fx/animation/keyframes/animation_name.json`


      *   This will contain the "code" for the animation, you can edit one in
      from AIT or follow [this
      video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03eyntLbXw) to see how to make one
      using BlockBench. (this video also shows how to add it ingame but we will
      still show you how here.)
          
      *   You can use any sound from any mod as a de/mat sfx, or even add your
      own by making a sound resourcepack, [check out this video on how to do
      so](https://youtu.be/igZQdEoxcQk?si=nlVLIUNUJxXHxu2u).
          

      Create a new **.json** file in the path


      > `data/namespace/fx/animation/type/animation_name_demat.json`


      Inside this new .json file, paste:


      > ```json

      > {

      >  "id": "id:animation_name_demat",

      >  "expected_state": "demat",

      >  "sound": "sound:id_demat"

      > }

      > ```


      **(the sound id doesn't have to be** `sound:id_demat` **but that will make
      it easier when making a mat animation or other things that uses sounds).**


      *   Replacing **(id:animationname\_demat)** with the name of the json file
      of the animation (either one you made or one from ait)
          
      *   Be reminded that you will have to repeate these steps if you want to
      make a remat animation BUT replace where it says `demat` with `mat`! And
      either reverse the demat animation you made or make an entire new one, up
      to you.
          
      *   Now put this **Datapack** into Minecraft.
          

      If you are confused, the json file should look something like this:


      ```json

      {
        "id": "ait:bnt_mat",
        "expected_state": "mat",
        "sound": "ait:tardis/bnt/mat"
      }

      ```
