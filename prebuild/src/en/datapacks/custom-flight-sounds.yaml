      ## Create a Datapack


      *   Follow the tutorial on the [Minecraft Wiki on
      datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) on how to set one up, use
      the namespace from earlier
          
      *   You can use any sound from any mod as a flight sound, or even add your
      own by making a sound resourcepack, [check out this video on how to do
      so](https://youtu.be/igZQdEoxcQk?si=nlVLIUNUJxXHxu2u).
          

      Create a new **.json** file in the path


      > `data/(namespace)/fx/flight/(flight_sound_name).json`


      Inside this new .json file, paste:


      > ```json

      > {

      >  "id": "(namespace:name)",

      >  "sound": "(sound:id)",

      >  "length": `VALUE`

      > }

      > ```


      *   Replace the **(namespace:name)** with the same name as the json file.
          
      *   Replace the **sound:id**, make and the sounds id matches what it is
      ingame (using the `/playsound` command), also try to name it a singular
      word.
          
      *   Replace the `VALUE` with the time of the sound (in seconds).
          
      *   Now put this **Datapack** into Minecraft.
