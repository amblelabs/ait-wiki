      ## Wait, You guys make these models but how do I!?


      Good question, we use a variety of Software and some of them are up to
      personal preference but here is what we recommend:


      *   Modeling and Texturing
          

      One of the basics we use is **BlockBench.** Blockbench is a 3d modeling
      software that uses voxels (cubes) instead of complex shapes like circles
      and triangles, and don't worry you won't need a degree in 3d modeling to
      use it. blockbench also has built in texture editing and creation.

      *   Audio
          

      for audio we suggest **Audacity.** Audacity is a free audio editing
      program that has a good amount of editing features for what you'll
      (probably) be using it for.

      ## Wait, Where do I get an empty pack to fill up?


      well you can always search for one but making all the directories in my
      opinion is way more fun! Here is the link to the minecraft wiki page about
      creating a datapack and resource pack.
