      ## Wait, You guys make these models but how do I!?


      Good question, we use a variety of Software and some of them are up to
      personal preference but We'll be providing free basic stuff for Datapacks

      ## Modeling and Textures


      One of the basics we use is **BlockBench.** Blockbench is a 3d modeling
      software that uses voxels (cubes) instead of complex shapes like circles
      and triangles, and don't worry you won't need a degree in 3d modeling to
      use it
