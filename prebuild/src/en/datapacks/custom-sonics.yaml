      {{< callout type="warning" >}} You need to learn how texture pack and
      datapacks works! {{< /callout >}}


      ## Sonic Texture & Model


      *   Make an sonic texture and model.
          
      *   Save your sonic texture and model to your Resource Pack that is called
      by your own custom datapack namespace (see below), naming it whatever you
      like. but do remember to call it something you can remember, with **.png**
      as the image’s format and the **.json** as the model’s format.

      ## Create a Datapack


      *   Follow the tutorial on the [Minecraft Wiki on
      datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) on how to set one up, use
      the namespace from earlier
          
      *   Create a new **.json** file in the path
          

      > `data/(namespace)/sonic/(sonic_texture_name).json`


      *   Inside this new .json file, paste


      > ```json

      > {

      >   "id": "(namespace):(exterior_texture_name)",

      >   "models":{

      >   "inactive": "(namespace):item/sonic/(refer to example below)",

      >   "interaction": "(namespace):item/sonic/(refer to example below)",

      >   "overload": "(namespace):item/sonic/(exterior_texture_name)",

      >   "scanning": "(namespace):item/sonic/(exterior_texture_name)",

      >   "tardis": "(namespace):item/sonic/(exterior_texture_name)"

      >   },

      >   "loyalty": {

      >   "type": "PILOT"

      > }

      > }

      > ```


      > > Note: If you have a custom category, instead of something like
      `"category": "ait:sonic/mechanical"` it would be `"category":
      "(namespace):(custom_category)"`.


      *   replacing the **namespace** and the **sonic\_texture\_name** with your
      own from earlier
          
      *   Now put this **datapack** into Minecraft.
