      ## [**Sonic**](/items/sonic-screwdriver/) Texture & Model


      *   Make a sonic texture and model.
          
      *   Save your sonic texture and model to your Resource Pack that is called
      by your own custom datapack namespace (see below), naming it whatever you
      like. but do remember to call it something you can remember, with **.png**
      as the image’s format and the **.json** as the model’s format.

      ## Create a Datapack


      *   Follow the tutorial on the [Minecraft Wiki on
      datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) on how to set one up, use
      the namespace from earlier
          
      *   Create a new **.json** file in the path
          

      > `data/(namespace)/sonic/(sonic_texture_name).json`


      *   Inside this new .json file, paste
          

      > ```json

      > {

      >   "id": "(namespace):(sonic_name)",

      >   "models":{

      >   "inactive": "(namespace):item/sonic/(sonic_model_name)",

      >   "interaction": "(namespace):item/sonic/(sonic_model_name)",

      >   "overload": "(namespace):item/sonic/(sonic_model_name)",

      >   "scanning": "(namespace):item/sonic/(sonic_model_name)",

      >   "tardis": "(namespace):item/sonic/(sonic_model_name)"

      >   },

      >   "loyalty": {

      >   "type": "(RANK TYPE)"

      > }

      > }

      > ```


      > > Note: If you have a custom category, instead of something like
      `"category": "ait:sonic/mechanical"` it would be `"category":
      "(namespace):(custom_category)"`.


      *   replacing the **namespace** and the **sonic\_texture\_name** with your
      own from earlier
          
      *   replace rank type with either; Owner, Pilot, Companion, Neutral,
      Reject
          
      *   Now put this **datapack** into Minecraft.

      Currently in-game your sonic will be something like
      `sonic.namespace.sonic_id` to fix this, make a folder in your resource
      packs **assets folder. (name this file** `lang` ). Then in that folder,
      make a file called `language_type.json` (for example **en\_us.json**).
      Inside of that json file put the following:


      > ```json

      > {

      > "sonic.namespace.name":"ingame name"

      > }

      > ```

      > 

      > *   Make sure to replace `namespace.name` with your namespace and name
      from the datapack and replace `ingame name` with what you want it to be
      called in game.
