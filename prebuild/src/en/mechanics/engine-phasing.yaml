      ## What IS Engine Phasing?


      Engine phasing is a negative consequence of your demat circuit having low
      durability, once the circuit reaches 300 durability (or less), engine
      phasing may randomly occur. If it does, the following things happen;


      *   TARDIS position randomized
          
      *   Causes the TARDIS to "Ghost Monument" (this can also "multi-phase"
      meaning it phases, goes on cooldown, and then phases again)
          

      ## How do I counter this?


      *   Keep circuit durability high
          
      *   Use [**sonic**](/items/sonic-screwdriver/) with the [**TARDIS**
      **mode**](items/sonic-screwdriver/#tardis-mode) on the exterior to cancel
      engine phasing

      ## Ghost Monument


      Ghost monuments can also be triggered manually like so:


      *   Have `Leave behind` set to `false` in the security settings (is false
      by default).
          
      *   Have `Ghost Monument` enabled in the server config (is enabled by
      default).
          
      *   Do a manual flight, and before the TARDIS arrives at the destination
      location have everyone leave the TARDIS.
          

      If you then go to the destination spot you'll see the following happening:


      1.  The TARDIS will land.
          
      2.  It will immediately take off again.
          
      3.  It will travel to the same coordinates again (which may take around 20
      seconds or so).
          
      4.  Repeat from step 1.
