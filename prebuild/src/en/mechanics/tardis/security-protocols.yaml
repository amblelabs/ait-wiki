      # TARDIS Security Features


      Feel like locking the door isn't enough? No worries as if you go into your
      [**Console**](/blocks/console/) then hit **Settings** above the **Sonic
      Settings** you should see the **Security** button. Right-clicking the
      button takes you to this menu...

      Here you can see when your TARDIS has been built, and you can change some
      Security settings.


      ## Leave Behind


      When activating this feature any other guest that doesn't have a
      [**Key**](/items/keys/) (that is linked to your TARDIS) will be left
      behind when taking off. This feature is inspired by the Doctor Who episode
      "Blink"


      ## Hostile Alarms


      When this feature has been activated any hostile mobs that enter the
      **TARDIS** will trigger the **Cloister Bell** until you have manually
      turned it off


      # Other Info


      # How to activate Isomorphic Security


      On the console, find "Isomorphic Security" and use a key linked to that
      TARDIS and click on the control. Once that's done, anyone that has a key
      that's linked to the current TARDIS can use the console, but anyone
      without a linked key cannot interact with the console at all, you can set
      what loyalty a user needs to be in order to bypass this, like companion
      for example via settings from the monitor.
