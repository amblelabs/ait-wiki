      ## How do i start flying around?


      *   Make sure you have enough power for your trip
          
      *   Disable the handbrake if it's active
          
      *   Pull the throttle up to any level you wish and take off
          
      *   When you reach your destination push the throttle back down
          
      *   However, during flights you'll have to do "flight event" **unless you
      have Protocol 116 enabled**
          

      ## What flight events are there?

      ## I don't know all the console controls, how do i know what to press?


      *   Fear not, simply put the [**sonic**](/items/sonic-screwdriver/) in
      scanning mode and into the sonic port on the console, now you'll be told
      what to press to complete a flight event.
          
      *   You MUST press the exclamation markers in this order `yellow, orange,
      red`
          

      ## Turns out I actually suck at flying the TARDIS even WITH the warnings,
      what do I do?


      *   Auto pilot is something you can use to turn off flight events, however
      it caps your speed low and you won't be able to gain loyalty.
          

      ## My controls are smoking and dont work


      Look at [control durability](/mechanics/tardis/control-durability/) This
      will tell you how to fix the damaged controls and what each stage does!
