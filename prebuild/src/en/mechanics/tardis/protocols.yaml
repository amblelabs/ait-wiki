      Protocols are controls on the TARDIS console that function to make your
      playthrough easier, here we have laid them out for you to better
      understand what function they serve when activated.


      To locate where these controls are on the console, use the [**Sonic
      Screwdriver**](/items/sonic-screwdriver/) while in scanning mode.


      Hope this helps!

      # Protocol 1913 (AKA **Siege Mode**)


      Siege Mode is a function on your TARDIS designed to keep the pilot safe,
      which should only be used as a last resort when all else fails.  

      Siege Mode disables the TARDIS power and shrinks the exterior to a smaller
      and more protected version. As explained earlier Siege Mode is designed to
      keep the pilot safe, and it completes this task by forcing the doors to be
      deadlock sealed and not allowing anyone in. Siege Mode requires fuel to be
      activated, if attempted to be activated without the necessary fuel it will
      fail.


      Siege Mode does not drain any [Artron energy](/mechanics/artron-energy/)
      while activated, this is because all systems are powered down. Including
      **life support**. While in Siege Mode, the TARDIS will become extremely
      cold, and you will begin to **freeze to death**, to combat this, leather
      armor is suggested to be worn while activated.


      As mentioned earlier, the TARDIS shrinks the exterior to a smaller and
      more protected version, this includes reducing its weight. The TARDIS is
      now able to be picked up by any third-party who comes across it, this is
      why it is highly recommended to activate your TARDIS **handbrake** while
      Siege Mode is activated to prevent unwanted plyers handling your TARDIS.


      **PLEASE NOTE THAT SIEGE MODE REQUIRES THE PLAYER TO HAVE INSTALLED THE
      DESPERATION CIRCUIT IN THE TARDIS ENGINE**

    alt: Cloak Mode
    value: >-
      # Protocol 3 (AKA **Cloak Mode**)


      Cloak Mode is a function on your TARDIS console designed to keep the
      TARDIS hidden when the chameleon circuit is faulty. Cloak Mode will render
      your TARDIS exterior invisible to the naked eye, and will reveal itself
      only when a pilot is holding a **[key](/items/keys/)** linked to the
      console. When a pilot, holding a key, is within 5 meters of the exterior,
      the TARDIS will start to reveal itself. The closer the pilot approaches
      the exterior the more the TARDIS will reveal itself.


      Cloak Mode requires [Artron energy](/mechanics/artron-energy/) to operate,
      make sure you have a hefty supply before you activate this emergency
      protocol!

    alt: Stabilisers
    value: >-
      # Stabilizers (AKA **Protocol 116**)


      The stabilizers are a function on your TARDIS console designed for when
      there is less than the required pilots to navigate the time vortex. This
      protocol allows for automated navigation throughout the time vortex, but
      is programmed to take the safest route possible which is not always the
      shortest. This protocol takes extra [Artron
      energy](/mechanics/artron-energy/) to operate so make sure you have enough
      fuel in your TARDIS before flight.

    alt: Hail Mary
    value: >-
      # Hail Mary (AKA **Protocol 813**)


      Hail Mary Mode is a function on your TARDIS console designed to rescue the
      pilot when in immediate danger of death. This protocol allows the TARDIS,
      when the handbrake is disabled, to rematerialize around the pilots
      position to rescue them from certain death.


      Hail Mary Mode also requires [Artron energy](/mechanics/artron-energy/) to
      operate, so make sure that the TARDIS has a healthy supply of fuel before
      activating this protocol.

    alt: Isomorphic Security
    value: >-
      # Isomorphic Security (AKA **Protocol 19**)


      On the console, find "Isomorphic Security" and use a key linked to the
      current TARDIS and click on the control. Once that's done, anyone that has
      a key linked to the current TARDIS can use the console, but anyone without
      a linked key cannot interact with the console at all, though via the
      security menu you're able to change what loyalty rank is required for
      players to interact with the console while Isomorphic is active.

    alt: Self-Destruct
    value: >-
      # Self-Destruct (AKA **Protocol 000**)


      This is a special kind of protocol that cannot be triggered via its own
      button, instead give the TARDIS a **Nether Star** via the telepathic
      circuits, this sends out the message "SELF DESTRUCT INITIATED ABORT SHIP"
      appear to anyone in the interior. Once everyone has vacated the interior
      the TARDIS deadlocks itself as the TARDIS star within goes supernova and
      blows up, resulting in a medium sized explosion where the TARDIS was.


      **PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS REQUIRES THE PLAYER TO HAVE PILOT LOYALTY**
  - _type: callout
    type: warning
    value: Once self destruct is enabled it cannot be stopped, so you better only
      let trustworthy people get inside your TARDIS, incase it is activated grab
      whatever you can from your interior. Once your TARDIS is destroyed it is
      not possible to retrieve destroyed items from it.

    alt: Engine Overload
    value: >-
      # Engine Overload (AKA **Protocol 515**)


      This protocol can be used for emergency escapes. How? It dumps all your
      artron and immediately travels to your destination, but (as a side effect)
      it does 1000 damage to each Circuit (aside from the Gravitational
      circuit).

    alt: Electric Discharge
    value: >-
      # Shell Repellent (AKA **Protocol 54**)


      It produces an electric shock around the exterior, if someone is near the
      "electrocution zone", it gives them the following effects as a result;


      *   darkness
          
      *   slowness
          
      *   poison
          
      *   weakness
          
      *   hunger
          
      *   mining fatigue
