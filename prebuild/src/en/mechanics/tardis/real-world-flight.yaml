      ## Real World Flight (RWF)


      Real world flight allows you to fly around the world in your Tardis
      without dematerializing and rematerializing.

      ## How To Use RWF


      First you must use the command:


      ```

      /ait flight [TARDIS ID]

      ```


      then you will see the outside of your Tardis like this:

      to start flying press the 'G' key, this will turn on the antigravs, then
      to actually start moving around press the 'G' key then press space to go
      up. that's about it.
