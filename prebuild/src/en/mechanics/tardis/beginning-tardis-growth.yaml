      ## Fabricating a Sonic Screwdriver


      ![](/images/mechanics/tardis/fabrication.webp)


      To fabricate a [**Sonic Screwdriver**](/items/sonic-screwdriver/), you'll
      need to find a blueprint for it; these blueprints can be found in all
      structures. You can see what the blueprint is for by holding shift while
      hovering your mouse over it in your inventory. To use the blueprint, you
      also need a [**Fabricator**](/blocks/fabricator). Fabricators need to be
      on top of a Smithing Table to work.


      **NOTE:** Most blueprints require zeiton shards or clusters, so make sure
      you have those beforehand! If you don't know where to find zeiton, see
      this page about
      [Zeiton](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/items/zeiton)


      Now that you have a Fabricator, right-click it with the blueprint for the
      Sonic Screwdriver. This will show all the items needed to fabricate the
      blueprint recipe. Some items needed for the recipe can vary in amount,
      which you can also see in the tooltip. We suggest getting the items about
      now if you haven't already.


      Once you have all the items needed, right-click the Fabricator while
      holding one of the items and the Fabricator will take it. Once you have
      placed all the items in the Fabricator, it will create the item. You
      simply need to right-click to obtain it.  

      Now that you have a Sonic Screwdriver, we can move on to getting coral
      fragments!


      ## Obtaining a Coral Growth


      ![](/images/mechanics/rift-chunks/rift_entity.png)


      Now that you have a Sonic Screwdriver, we can start getting coral
      fragments! Nine coral fragments can used to make a Coral Growth which is
      the key to growing a TARDIS, and is also used for growing a console for
      said TARDIS. You can obtain coral fragments by right-clicking a
      [**Rift**](/mechanics/rift-chunks). A Rift is is a crack in time that
      spawns in rift chunks, which can be found using a [**Rift
      Scanner**](/mechanics/rift-chunks/#how-do-i-find-a-rift-chunk).  

      Right-clicking a rift will either give you a coral fragment, paper, or
      place some coral blocks around the rift. If you're holding a Sonic
      Screwdriver, it will also refill your sonic's Artron reserve. Note that
      you will take some damage when you right click a rift. Avoid walking into
      them, too - you'll be flung across time and space! Once you have nine
      coral fragments, you can craft a Coral Growth by placing all nine of them
      in a crafting table. We recommend getting eighteen fragments while you're
      on the hunt, as you can then craft two Growths; one for the TARDIS, one
      for the console.


      ## Starting TARDIS Growth


      ![](/images/mechanics/tardis/coral-growing.webp)


      Now that you have a Coral Growth, you can start growing it. To start the
      process, you will need to be in a rift chunk, which can be found using the
      Rift Scanner you used to find the Rifts earlier. It will point in the
      direction of the nearest Rift Chunk. Once you're in a rift chunk, you will
      need soul sand: Growths only grow on soul sand, so place it down and then
      place the Coral Growth on top of it. Overtime, it will start growing!


      At this point, you can now move onto Completing TARDIS Growth.

      ## How do I complete growing the TARDIS?


      (recipes are at the bottom of this page!)


      *   The Coral Shell


      ![](/images/mechanics/tardis/coral_setup/shell.png)


      *   Once the coral plant has fully grown, it will become open. Now you
      need to give it a Coral Cage by right clicking the exterior with a Coral
      Cage. After that you need to create the cage panels by right clicking the
      exterior with 8 Plasmic Material.
          
      *   The Matrix Energizer
          

      ![](/images/mechanics/tardis/coral_setup/matrix.png)


      *   Once that is done you need to give the TARDIS its "personality", to do
      this you will need to place a Matrix Energizer on top of a naturally
      spawned Sculk Shrieker block, Right Click the Matrix Energizer with a
      Nether Star and activate it by making the Shriek shriek. Doing so will
      slowly fill up a bar on the side of the Matrix Energizer block. Remember
      to keep an eye on your surroundings if you are doing this in the Deep Dark


      YOU CANNOT MOVE THE SHRIEKER, DOING SO WILL DISABLE THE ABILITY TO CHARGE
      THE MATRIX!


      *   The Personality Matrix


      ![](/images/mechanics/tardis/coral_setup/personality.png)


      *   When the bar is full, it will break and drop the Personality Matrix,
      if you hover over the item and press shift you may notice that is has a
      random color hex code and random name. Take the Personality Matrix into
      your newly grown coral and throw it into any water source, you will then
      be asked to leave the TARDIS so it can finish building.


      ### THIS WILL MEAN THE TARDIS INTERIOR WILL BE WIPED AND YOU WILL LOSE
      EVERYTHING YOU HAVE PLACED INSIDE!!!


      * * *


      *   REMINDER!


      Don't forget to set up the engine and essential components when the TARDIS
      is complete. It is also recommended to wear a resperator when first
      entering a complete TARDIS as there is no life support and you will begin
      to die upon entering!
