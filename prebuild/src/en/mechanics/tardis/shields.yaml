      ## How do I use the shields?


      The shields have 2 modes:


      1.  Invisible
          

      *   Invisible shields block liquids from entering and block you from
      getting sucked out into the vortex if your doors are open
          
      *   Activate them by right clicking once.
          

      2.  Visible

      *   The Visible ones block players under the companion loyalty level from
      entering your TARDIS, they also incinerate any sort of projectile and will
      push back any type of entity.
          
      *   Activate them by shift left clicking or just right clicking the shield
      control when the invisible shields are active.
          

      Once you activate the shields they start off by default as invisible.  

      **_NOTE: SHIELDS USE ARTRON ENERGY WHILE ACTIVE, MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR
      FUEL SUPPLY BEFORE ACTIVATING THIS PROTOCOL_**
