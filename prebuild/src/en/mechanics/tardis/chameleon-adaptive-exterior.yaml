      Adaptive exterior (also known as chameleon exterior) is a special kind of
      exterior category.


      This is a unique exterior that disguises itself as a tree/desert
      well/chorus plant/giant mushroom etc. depending on the biome. To enable
      it, just select the `Adaptive` exterior type in the monitor _(it's listed
      with the rest of the exteriors in the mod)._


      Due to the way it was implemented it has 2 properties:


      *   It's undetectable. You can't use F3, WAILA, Jade or X-ray mods to find
      a disguised TARDIS.
          
      *   It's dynamic. It doesn't have any presets, therefore it finds the
      shape to take dynamically. Meaning it works with modded (& datapack)
      biomes.
          

      To open a camouflaged TARDIS, right-click the bottom block, where the
      exterior would normally be. Doing that will reveal the capsule. Closing
      the door will camouflage it back.


      ## The exterior hides itself very effectively


      Try and find the TARDIS here:

      If you can't, it's the tree on the right.

      ## Sonic Disguise Changer


      The [**sonic screwdriver**](/items/sonic-screwdriver/) allows you to
      change the current disguise more conveniently:


      1.  Set sonic screwdriver to `INTERACTION` mode.
          
      2.  Put sonic screwdriver in off-hand.
          
      3.  Using it now on the bottom block of the TARDIS exterior will make it
      swap to a different disguise (appropriate to the biome, of course).
          

      NOTE:


      If [**isomorphic
      security**](/mechanics/tardis/protocols/#protocol-19-aka-isomorphic-security)
      is active, then it requires the respective loyalty and a linked
      [**key**](/items/keys/).  
        
      If it's not active, then it requires at least _PILOT_
      [loyalty](/tardis/loyalty) (or OP).
