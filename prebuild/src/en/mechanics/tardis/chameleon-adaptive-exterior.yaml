      Chameleon exterior also known as the adaptive exterior is a special kind
      of exterior category.


      This is a unique exterior that turns into a tree/desert well/chorus
      plant/giant mushroom and etc. depending on the biome. To enable it, just
      select the `Adaptive` exterior type in the monitor _(its listed with the
      rest of the exteriors in the mod)_


      Due to the way it was implemented it has 2 qualities,


      *   It's undetectable. You can't use F3, WAILA, Jade or X-ray mods to find
      a disguised TARDIS.
          
      *   It's dynamic. It doesn't have any presets, therefore it finds the
      shape to take dynamically. Meaning it works with modded (& datapack)
      biomes.
          

      To open a camouflaged TARDIS, click the bottom block, where the exterior
      would normally be. Doing that will reveal the capsule. Closing the door
      will camouflage it back.


      ## The exterior is extremely useful to hide


      try and find the TARDIS here:
