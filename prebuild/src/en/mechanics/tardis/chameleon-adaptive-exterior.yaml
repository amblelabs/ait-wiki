      The Adaptive Exterior (also known as the Chameleon Exterior) is a unique
      type of exterior.  
        
      While using this exterior, your TARDIS can disguise itself as a tree,
      structure or other type of plant depending on the biome your TARDIS is in.
      To enable it, select the `Adaptive` exterior type in the monitor _(it's
      listed with the rest of the exteriors in the mod)._  
        
      Due to the way it was implemented it has 2 properties:


      *   It's undetectable. You can't use F3, WAILA, Jade or X-ray mods to find
      a disguised TARDIS.
          
      *   It's dynamic. It doesn't have any presets, therefore it finds the
      shape to take dynamically. Meaning it works with modded (& datapack)
      biomes.
          

      To open a camouflaged TARDIS, right-click the bottom block, where the
      exterior would normally be. Doing that will reveal the capsule. Closing
      the door will camouflage it back.  
        
      Try and spot the TARDIS in the image below

      If you can't see it, it's the tree on the right.

      ## Sonic Disguise Changer


      The [**sonic screwdriver**](/items/sonic-screwdriver/) allows you to
      change the current disguise more conveniently:


      1.  Set sonic screwdriver to `INTERACTION` mode.
          
      2.  Put sonic screwdriver in off-hand.
          
      3.  Using it on the bottom-most block of the TARDIS exterior will make it
      swap to a different disguise (appropriate to the biome, of course).
          

      NOTE:


      If [**isomorphic
      security**](/mechanics/tardis/protocols/#protocol-19-aka-isomorphic-security)
      is active, then it requires the respective loyalty and a linked
      [**key**](/items/keys/).  

      If it's not active, then it requires at least _PILOT_
      [loyalty](/tardis/loyalty) (or operator).
