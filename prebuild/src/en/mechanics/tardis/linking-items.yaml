      ## How to link items


      On the console, find the **telepathic circuit** and right click it with
      the linkable item. Linkable items include:


      TARDIS Key(../../items/sonic)


      Stattenhiem Remote


      ## How come my sonic isn't linking?


      For the sonic screwdriver specifically, you will need to insert it into
      the **sonic port** for it to link properly.


      ## Any useful commands?


      Certainly! the command to link different linkable items (like the
      sonic/keys/Stattenheim remote) its:


      > /ait link


      ...And that should link your currently held item.
