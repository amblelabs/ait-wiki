      ## How to link items


      On the console, find the **Telepathic Circuits** and right click it with
      the linkable item.


      Linkable items include:


      *   [**TARDIS Keys**](/items/keys/)
          
      *   [**Sonic Screwdrivers**](/items/sonic-screwdriver/)
          
      *   [**Stattenheim Remotes**](/items/stattenheim-remote/)
          
      *   [**Handles**](/items/handles/)
          

      ## Why isn't my Sonic linking?


      For the Sonic Screwdriver specifically, you will need to insert it into
      the **Sonic Port** for it to link properly.  

      If the sonic is already linked to another TARDIS, you must hold shift
      whilst inserting it to relink it, otherwise it will just charge in the
      port.


      ## Any useful commands?


      Certainly! The command to link different linkable items (like the
      sonic/keys/stattenheim remote) is:


      `/ait link <id or ~ or ^>`
sidebar:
  open: false
  exclude: false
