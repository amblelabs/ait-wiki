      ## How to link items


      On the console, find the **telepathic circuit** and right click it with
      the linkable item.


      Linkable items include:


      *   **[Keys](/items/keys/)**
          
      *   Sonic Screwdriver
          
      *   Stattenhiem Remote
          
      *   Handles
          

      ## How come my sonic isn't linking?


      For the sonic screwdriver specifically, you will need to insert it into
      the **sonic port** for it to link properly.


      ## Any useful commands?


      Certainly! The command to link different linkable items (like the
      sonic/keys/stattenheim remote) is:


      > /ait link <id or ~ or ^>
sidebar:
  open: false
  exclude: false
