      ## What is a Rift Chunk?


      A rift chunk is a tear in space-time that can be found in any dimension.
      It's used to grow the [**Coral Growth**](/items/coral-growth) (tardis
      coral) or siphoned for [**Artron Energy**](/mechanics/artron-energy/) that
      the TARDIS uses for fuel. You can fly the TARDIS into a rift chunk to
      syphon fuel more efficiently (faster) or as an alternative, you can use an
      [**Artron Collector**](/mechanics/artron-energy/#artron-collector-block)
      to collect [**Artron Energy**](/mechanics/artron-energy/) while outside
      the TARDIS.


      ## How do I find a Rift Chunk?


      To locate a rift chunk, you will need to craft a **Rift Scanner** with the
      recipe below:


      ![](/images/mechanics/rift-chunks/scanner-recipe.png)


      The **Rift Scanner** is a hand-held device that acts very similarly to a
      compass, but instead homes in on **Rift Chunks**. To locate a **Rift
      Chunk** using this device, simply right-click the rift scanner in your
      hand and follow the dial to you destination.


      The device will point to the centre of the **Rift Chunk**, when you are at
      the centre it will spin frantically.


      ## Cracks In Time!

      These can spawn in rift chunks,if you right click on them they have a
      chance of either; dropping a Coral Fragment, Paper, or placing some Coral
      Blocks around its area. You can also recharge the sonic if you hold it and
      Right Click the Rift.  

      If you use the [**Sonic Screwdriver**](/items/sonic-screwdriver/) in Interact Mode on a rift, it will drop
      TARDIS coral 100% of the time.
