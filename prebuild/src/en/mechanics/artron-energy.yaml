      ## What Is It?


      **Artron Energy** is the fuel the TARDIS runs on. It is known in the
      TARDIS itself as _"AU"_, or just simply as a percentage. It comes from
      rifts in Overworld, or passively anywhere.

      ## Where Is It Collected From?


      **Artron Energy** is collected by the TARDIS during **refueling**, and can
      be passively gained from anywhere (slowly) or gained in larger amounts
      quicker in a [**rift chunk**](../rift-chunks).


      It can also be collected in **Artron Collectors**, which come in block and
      item form.


      ## Artron Collector Unit


      It is crafted with this recipe:


      ![](/images/mechanics/artron/collector-recipe.png)


      To use it, simply hold the item in your hand while and `right-click` the
      Artron Collecter Block and it will slowly drain the block. To fill up your
      TARDIS with it, `crouch right-click` the console.


      ## Artron Collector Block


      It is crafted with this recipe:


      ![](/images/mechanics/artron/panel-recipe.png)


      It works the same as the panel, but instead it doesn't require you to hold
      the item. It is instead placed down. You can then shift right-click this
      block with a panel to drain its storage.
