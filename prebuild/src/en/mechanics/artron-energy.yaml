      ## What Is It?


      **Artron Energy** is the fuel the TARDIS runs on. It is known in the
      TARDIS itself as _"AU"_, or just simply as a percentage. It comes from
      rifts in Overworld, or passively anywhere.

      ## Where Is It Collected From?


      **Artron Energy** is collected by the TARDIS during **refueling**, and can
      be passively gained from anywhere (slowly) or gained in larger amounts
      quicker in a [**rift chunk**](../rift-chunks).


      It can also be collected in **Artron Collectors**, which come in block and
      item form.


      ## Artron Collector Block


      It is crafted with this recipe:


      ![](/images/mechanics/artron/collector-recipe.png)


      To use it, place it in a rift chunk and it will slowly drain the chunk
      over time (filling up the collector block)


      ## Artron Collector Unit


      It is crafted with this recipe:


      ![](/images/mechanics/artron/panel-recipe.png)


      You can use this on the Artron Collector by holding this item and
      `right-clicking` which will then take the artron from the block and fill
      this up, you can then use this on the console and it will put it's artron
      into the console
