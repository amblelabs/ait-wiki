      ## What does it do?


      Floats far below the TARDIS interior and spins at a slow pace. When **The
      TARDIS** is refueling the Eye of Harmony's Rays begin pulsing.


      If a player drops items into the Eye of Harmony, they will be deposited
      back at the main door of the TARDIS


      If a player falls into the Eye of Harmony, they will be deposited back at
      the main door of the TARDIS


      **NOTE: THE EYE OF HARMONY GOES SUPER-NOVA DURING SECURITY PROTOCOL 000
      (Self-Destruct). ALL ITEMS LEFT INSIDE THE INTERIOR OF THE TARDIS WILL BE
      DESTROYED** plus it's really gigantic :3
