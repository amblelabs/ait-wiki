      The Sonic Screwdriver is a handheld device used for various tasks, these
      tasks range from seeing what the console do, to blowing up TNT.


      To **link** a Sonic Screwdriver to a [**TARDIS Console**](/blocks/console)
      right-click on the **Sonic Port** whilst holding the Sonic Screwdriver.  

      To **remove** it punch the Sonic Screwdriver in the **Sonic Port**, and it
      will eject from the [**Console**](/blocks/console).

      To **charge** a Sonic Screwdriver insert it into a [**TARDIS
      Console**](/blocks/console). Like you would for linking it then the Sonic
      Screwdriver should start charging (keep in mind the Sonic Screwdriver uses
      the [**Artron Energy**](/mechanics/artron-energy/) to charge).

      ## Sonic Modes


      The sonic has 5 modes, those being:


      *   Inactive (Powered Off)
          
      *   Interaction
          
      *   Overload
          
      *   Scanning
          
      *   TARDIS
          
      *   Inactive Mode
          
          ## Inactive Mode
          
          **Inactive** mode renders the Sonic Screwdriver unusable.
          
          ## Interaction Mode
          
          **Interaction** mode allows the Sonic Screwdriver to:
          
          *   Ignite candles, campfires and unlit torches, open iron doors/trap doors
              
          *   Change repeaters' delay and mode.
              
          
          ## Overload Mode
          
          **Overload** mode allows the Sonic Screwdriver to:
          
          *   Ignite TNT,
              
          *   Toggle redstone lamps,
              
          *   Shatter glass blocks.
              
          
          ## Scanning Mode
          
          **Scanning** mode allows the Sonic Screwdriver to:
          
          *   Tell you what console controls are by hovering over the Control Entities and also show you their hitboxes. (the latter is off by default; check the [**config**](/mechanics/config-options/))
              
          *   Check if you are located inside a [**Rift Chunk**](/mechanics/rift-chunks) and how much [**Artron Energy**](/mechanics/artron-energy/) is stored in that chunk.
              
          *   In addition, hovering over a generalized subsystem core will tell you both the name and the durability of the subsystem that it holds. (If a particular subsystem can't lose durability it will only show the name.)
              
          *   You can also scan blocks and entities for info such as: health, required mining tool, and blast resistance.
              
          *   It also allows the ability see where your TARDIS is by `right clicking`on a Zeiton Cluster or Bell blocks.
              
          
          ## TARDIS Mode
          
          **TARDIS** mode provides the following features:
          
          *   When inside the TARDIS:
              
              *   Looking up and using the sonic triggers demat.
                  
              *   Looking down and using the sonic activates the handbrake and refueler.
                  
          *   When outside the TARDIS:
              
              *   You can summon the TARDIS by right-clicking a valid landing spot near you, which needs to be within 256 blocks of the TARDIS exterior. However you also need the "PILOT" rank (loyalty).
                  
              *   Looking up (with the sonic in the **_off-hand_**) and using the sonic will trigger the demat.
                  
              *   Looking down (with the sonic in the **_off-hand_**) and using the sonic activates the handbrake and refuels the TARDIS.

      ## Sonic Settings & Configuration


      By default, you receive the “Prime” when crafting it or by getting it from
      the creative menu but there is a way to modify the Sonic Screwdriver
      casing, check it’s power, see what TARDIS it’s linked to and what casing
      it has.

      ## **To change the sonic casing**

      *   Place the Sonic Screwdriver into the port.
          
      *   Open the Monitor
          
      *   Select the "Sonic Settings" Option
          
      *   Use the buttons to change and select your casing  
          (more can be added with [datapacks](/datapacks/custom-sonics/))

      ## Sonic TARDIS Repair


      After crashing your TARDIS, repairing it would take a while but there is
      an alternative to speed up the repair process and to do this hold your
      Sonic Screwdriver (in Interaction or Overload) and right click the
      **TARDIS Exterior**.


      The Sonic Screwdriver should be inserted into the “keyhole” and start
      speeding up the TARDIS repair just like the the (Doctor WHO 60th 2nd
      Special Episode: Wild Blue Yonder).


      If you right click the **TARDIS Exterior** when its repairing the Sonic
      Screwdriver will tell you how many seconds there is till the TARDIS repair
      has finished (This will not destroy your existing interior and replace it
      with a new one).


      Once the repair has finished **shift+right-click** the Sonic Screwdriver
      and it should pop out of the **TARDIS Exterior** and the TARDIS is
      repaired for you to use again.

      ## Other Info


      If you don’t know what block can be interacted with a Sonic Screwdriver,
      make sure you have the Sonic Screwdriver in your hand and if you face a
      block (that can be interacted with a sonic then the crosshair should look
      a bit like the Sonic Screwdriver).


      Some blocks would need to be interacted in the **Interaction** Mode or the
      **Overload** Mode. **_The sonic can be used to cancel out engine phasing
      aswell_**


      ![](/images/items/sonic/crosshair.png)


      Once the Sonic Screwdriver runs out of charge it will be stuck on
      **Inactive** Mode till you have charged your Sonic Screwdriver in the
      **Sonic Port**!


      Also if you put the **Sonic Screwdriver** (in **Scanning** Mode) in the
      **Sonic Port** then it would allow you to view which buttons need to be
      pressed for you to fly without crashing (**Flight Events**).


      In addition, the sonic's pitch increases with your head velocity.
