      ## What is this?


      To use it, simply hold the item in your hand while and `right-click` the
      Artron Collecter Block and it will slowly drain the block. To fill up your
      TARDIS with it, `crouch right-click` the console.


      ## Why cant i just use normal zeiton?


      Normal zeiton hasent been modified to actually be able to hold up the
      required amount of artron units.


      ## Well how do i get charged zeiton then?

      ## Why does it say 0/5000 AU?


      The zeiton crystal can hold up to 5000 artron units,which is the required
      amount for a TARDIS coral to reform its interior for usage,to actually
      charge it use the artron collector in a rift chunk and harvest the artron
      units from it.
