      ## What do they do?


      Everything after iron unlocks snapping if you have enough loyalty for it.
      Each rank of key increases the snapping range aside from iron, which
      doesnâ€™t give the ability to snap.


      To snap, you simply press the V key or whatever key that's bound to
      snapping.
