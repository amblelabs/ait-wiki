      **What Does The Psychic Paper Do?**


      It does 2 things;


      1.  Grants "Hero of the Village" status effect, making trades much cheaper
          
      2.  Changes your in-game name. This happens if you rename the Psychic
      Paper in an anvil, then holding it in your offhand or main hand.
