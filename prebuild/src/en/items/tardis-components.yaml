      **What are all of these things?**


      These are the new resources that are used to craft things via the
      fabricator blueprints. All the fluid/mercurial links are made via the
      fabricator as they have blueprints, the rest have their own crafting
      recipes.

      # **Subsystems/circuits**


      These new subsystems/circuits are needed to activate and or use certain
      functions of the TARDIS,theyâ€™ll need power.

      ## How do i use them?


      They are used to access certain functions of the Tardis. How? By inserting
      them (with `right click`) into the Generalized Subsystem Core.


      *   **WARNING circuits have durability.**

      ## What each circuit does?


      *   Demat circuit; needed to demateralize and remateralize.
          
      *   Backup circuit; transfers artron to the TARDIS once it runs out of
      power.
          
      *   Chameleon circuit; needed to switch exteriors,cloak and use the
      adaptive exterior.
          
      *   Desperation circuit; allows the usage of siege mode/protocols.
          
      *   Gravitational circuit; unlocks anti-mavs.
          
      *   Life support; gives constant regeneration within the TARDIS.
          
      *   Stabilizers; unlocks P116 (auto-pilot)
          
      *   Shield circuit; unlocks both shield types
