      ## Forking the Wiki


      1.  Go to the github for the wiki
      [LINK](https://github.com/amblelabs/ait-wiki/fork) (this link brings you
      to the forking page for the wiki)
          
      2.  Choose a unique name for your fork (e.g. ait-wiki-my-fixes)
          
      3.  Press "Create fork"
          
      4.  Open [PageCMS](https://pagescms.org) and sign in to your github
          
      5.  Open your fork of the wiki and start editing
          

      ## Using PageCMS


      **To author content**


      1.  Open the already created entry
          
      2.  Press "+ Add an item" under the "Body" field
          
      3.  Choose the content block (text, image, etc.)
          
      4.  In the text block, you can use commands by typing the slash (`/`)
      symbol and by selecting text
          
      5.  If you want to add more content, go to step 2
          
      6.  Press "Save"
          

      **To create a new page**


      1.  go to "Wiki" tab in the sidebar
          
      2.  go to the category you want to create the page in (e.g. blocks, or
      mechanics, etc)
          
      3.  if you want to create a new category press on the "+" folder button.
          
      4.  press "Add an entry"
          
      5.  Fill out the title
          
      6.  Press "Save"

      ## Good Practices


      **Links**


      Try to prevent using full links that include the protocol and domain when
      linking to another page of the wiki itself, because otherwise it opens in
      a new tab. For example, instead of  

      `https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/items/zeiton-dust/`, use this
      instead: `/items/zeiton-dust/`.  

      That way the page doesn't open in a new tab when clicked. When the link
      leads to an external site, then use the full link of course, because then
      we leave the confines of the Wiki and then opening a new tab is ok.
