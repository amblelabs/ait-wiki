      ## Current version; 1.2.12


      *   Emission on consoles is lacking with shaders (Works for doors
      surprisingly)
          
      *   On Forge, the blueprints gambling was reimplemented when changing from
      one container to another.
          
      *   Vortexs not vortexing _(they arent rendering correctly)_
          
      *   The "boti" placeholder is weird on non built in exteriors
          
      *   TARDISes exteriors are aparently duping again i guess
          

      * * *


      ## ISSUES


      The following is a list of issues and changelogs in no particular order:


      *   At some point, spilling tea on the console used to crash the entire
      game.
          
      *   Interacting with the Hammer Manager on the Coral console, without it
      having a Hammer on it, used to crash dedicated servers.
          
      *   On 1.2.11, someone _(Presumibly Loqor)_ messed up all the console and
      exterior emissions, causing them to look almost completely white.
          
      *   AIT 1.2.8 was so evil it was removed from existence.
          
      *   For a while, piloting the TARDIS on maximum speed would cause it to
      instantly crash.
          
      *   Some Planet blocks were totally uncraftable until 1.2.9
          
      *   On some point, the Dematerialization sounds used to keep playing in a
      TARDIS' last postition, even after it had departed completely from there.
          
      *   "control entities are no longer living entities" — 1.2.4.2811
          
      *   At some point, [Gallifrey
      Falls](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/blocks/gallifrey-falls/)
      painting kept turning into
      [Trenzalore](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/blocks/trenzalore/), but
      no more.
          
      *   "randomizer and structure locator no longer throw up when you rejoin
      the world" — 1.2.4.2811
          
      *   Real World Flight, _(AKA tardis hover mode)_ used to Brick your world.
      It was removed due to this.
          
      *   "Removed pottery shards from opinions" — 1.2.1.2808
          
      *   On 1.2.11, Dev Exclusive Exteriors werent exclusive anymore. This was
      fixed on 1.2.12 and they are back to exclusiveness again.
          
      *   "/ait erase-chunks is no longer accessible by non-op people.
      whoopsie." — 1.2.0.2786
          
      *   For a while TARDIS' exteriors shells could render umproperly and
      become invisible. This was "fixed" two times in two diferent versions
      before begin actually fixed.
          
      *   For a while, you could insta-travel by crashing the TARDIS.
          
      *   On 1.0.3 respirators didnt render lol
          
      *   "_Perhaps_ fixed the player being able to fall and teleport back to
      the interior door." — 1.0.3
          
      *   For a while, budding zeiton block would grow amethyst instead of
      zeiton. Fixed on 1.0.2
