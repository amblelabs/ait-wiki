      Linkables are elements of the game which have the ability to be linked to
      a TARDIS.


      Those can be items, blocks, entities (& more if you implement it
      yourself).


      # Items


      To make your item linkable just extend the `LinkableItem` class, then use
      one of the static methods it provides to get the tardis instance.


      # Blocks


      Since blocks cannot contain NBT data on their own, it is impossible to
      save the TARDIS id the block belongs to in the block itself.


      Therefore, this only works if your block has a block entity.


      Make your block entity class extend the `LinkableBlockEntity` class.


      The base `LinkableBlockEntity` class will not link on it’s own, to
      forcefully link it use one of the `#link` method it provides.


      To make it easier, we’ve also made an `InteriorLinkableBlockEntity` which
      will automatically link to the interior it gets placed in.


      If you already save or read some NBT data in your block entity, make sure
      that the overriden `#readNbt` and `#writeNbt` methods also call their
      super variant (e.g. `super.readNbt(whatever);`). Otherwise, the code that
      is responsible for saving and reading the link data will not execute.
