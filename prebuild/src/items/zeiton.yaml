      ## What do i use zeiton for?


      1.  Zeiton is apart of the crafting recepie for the tardis coral
          
      2.  Used for the sonic screwdriver
          
      3.  Used to get charged zeiton a alternate to the nether star for
      reconfiguring your coral
          
      4.  Zeiton dust
          
      5.  Probably more that im forgetting in here.
