      These can be used to save coordinates for a later date, or to share
      coordinates with friends. They also have the ability to be customized
      either by naming them in an anvil or dyeing them with any color in the
      game (only when they have set coordinates saved!). To see what coordinates
      are saved onto the cartridge, hover over it in your inventory and hold
      `shift`.

      have multiple waypoint cartridges!
