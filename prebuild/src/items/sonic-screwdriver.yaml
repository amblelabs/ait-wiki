      # Sonic Screwdriver


      The Sonic Screwdriver is a multi-purpose handheld device capable of a
      variety of tasks, ranging from TNT detonation to TARDIS summoning.


      ## Obtaining


      The Sonic Screwdriver is created using the
      [Fabricator](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/blocks/fabricator),
      requiring a matching Blueprint and the following materials:


      *   1x Artron Collector Unit
          
      *   5-8x Zeiton Shards
          
      *   3-5x Iron Ingots
          
      *   1x Redstone Repeater
          
      *   5-6x Redstone Dust
          

      ## Charging and Linking


      Once created, the Sonic Screwdriver will require power to operate, it can
      be charged either from an Artron Collector or by inserting it into the
      Sonic Port on the TARDIS Console.


      Once inserted into the Console, the Sonic will be linked to the TARDIS,
      and cannot be linked to another.


      To remove it from the Sonic Port, left click it and it will drop as an
      item.
