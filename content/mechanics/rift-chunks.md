## What is a Rift Chunk?
**A rift chunk** is a tear in space-time that can be found in any dimension. It's used to grow 
the **TARDIS Coral** or siphoned for [**Artron Energy**](../artron) that the TARDIS uses for fuel.
You can fly the TARDIS into a rift chunk to syphon fuel more efficiently (faster) or as an alternative, you can use an [**Artron Collector**](../artron#artron-collector-block) 
to collect [**Artron Energy**](../artron) while outside the TARDIS.

## How do I find a Rift Chunk?
To locate a rift chunk, you will need to craft a **Rift Scanner** with the recipe below:

The **Rift Scanner** is a hand-held device that acts very similarly to a compass, but instead homes in on **Rift Chunks**. To locate a **Rift Chunk** using this device, simply right-click the rift scanner in your hand and follow the dial to you destination.

The device will point to the centre of the **Rift Chunk**, when you are at the centre it will spin frantically.

## Cracks In Time!

These can spawn in rift chunks,if you right click on them they have a chance of either; dropping a Coral Fragment, Paper, or placing some Coral Blocks around its area. You can also recharge the sonic if you hold it and Right Click the Rift.
<br>If you use the Sonic Screwdriver in **Interact Mode** on a rift, it will drop TARDIS coral 100% of the time.
