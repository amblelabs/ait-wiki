## How do i start flying around?

* Make sure you have enough power for your trip
* Disable the handbrake if it's active
* Pull the throttle up to any level you wish and take off
* When you reach your destination push the throttle back down
* However, during flights you'll have to do "flight event" **unless you have Protocol 116 enabled**


## What flight events are there?

1 BUTTON EVENTS

* Artron drain detected!
1. Refueler
   
* Directional error!
1. Direction
   
* Increment scale error! Recalculation necessary!
1. Increment
   
* Gravity miscalculation!
1. Antigravs
   
* Ship computer offline!
1. P116

2 BUTTON EVENTS

* Drifting off course X!
  1. Dimension
  2. X
     
* Drifting off course Y!
1. Dimension
2. Y
   
* Drifting off course Z!
1. Dimension
2. Z
   
* Debris incoming!
1. Direction
2. Randomizer
   
* Vortex drift: acceleration necessarry!
1. Increment
2. Throttle
   
* Immediate cloaking necessarry!
1. Protocol 3
2. Randomizer
   
* DIMENSION BREACH: SECURE DOORS
1. Dimension
2. Door Control
   
* Small debries field!
1. Increment
2.  Shields

3 BUTTON EVENTS

* Unstable landing posistion!
1. Land Type
2. Y
3. Set Waypoint

* TARDIS off course!
1. Handbrake
2. Throttle
3. Randomizer

* Power drain imminent!
1. Power
2. Refueler
3. Randomizer

## I have dementia what do I do?

* Fear not, simply put the sonic in scanning mode and into the sonic port on the console, now you'll be told what to press to complete a flight event.

## Turns out I actually suck at flying the TARDIS even WITH the warnings, what do I do?

* Auto pilot is something you can use to turn off flight events, however it caps your speed low and you won't be able to gain loyalty.


## My controls are smoking and dont work

Look at [control durability](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/mechanics/tardis/control_durability/) This will tell you how to fix the damaged controls and what each stage does!
