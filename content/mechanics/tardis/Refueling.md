## How do I refuel my TARDIS?
Thankfully refuelling is relatively simple.<br>
Step 1. Land your TARDIS / crash it (depending on your playstyle)<br>
Step 2. Locate and activate the ***Handbrake*** and the ***Refueler***<br>
Step 3. Leave your TARDIS or continue expanding your interior until the green bar in the ***Monitor*** is full or at your desired stage<br>
Step 4. Take off and explore the universe!<br>

<br>**You will notice if you are not in a rift chunk, then white smoke particles will emanate from the console to indicate it is refueling.
If instead white sparks are emenating from it, this indicates the TARDIS is in a Rift Chunk, which makes refueling take less time. The TARDIS will alert you when it is inside a rift chunk***

<br>**NOTE: REFUELING WILL WORK EVEN IF THE TARDIS POWER IS OFF**
