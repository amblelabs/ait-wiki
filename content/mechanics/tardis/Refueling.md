## How do I refuel my TARDIS?
Thankfully refuelling is relatively simple.<br>
Step 1. Land your TARDIS / crash it (depending on your playstyle)<br>
Step 2. Locate and activate the ***Handbrake*** and the ***Refueler***<br>
**You will notice white sparks coming from the console, this indicates that refueling has started, within ***Rift Chunks*** refueling takes less time**
Step 3. Leave your TARDIS or continue expanding your interior until the green bar in the ***Monitor*** is full or at your desired stage<br>
Step 4. Take off and explore the universe!<br>


<br>**NOTE: REFUELING WILL WORK EVEN IF THE TARDIS POWER IS OFF**
