## How do I refuel my TARDIS?
Thankfully refuelling is relatively simple.<br>
Step 1. Land your TARDIS / crash it (depending on your playstyle)<br>
Step 2. Locate and activate the ***Handbrake*** and the ***Refueler***<br>
Step 3. Leave your TARDIS or continue expanding your interior until the green bar in the ***Monitor*** is full or at your desired stage<br>
Step 4. Take off and explore the universe!<br>

<br>**Particles emanating from the console indicate it is refueling. If the particles are white smoke, this indicates you are not in a rift chunk.**
<br>If instead white sparks are emanating from it, this indicates the TARDIS is in a Rift Chunk, which makes refueling take less time.
<br>The TARDIS will alert you when it is inside a ***rift chunk***

<br>**NOTE: REFUELING WILL WORK EVEN IF THE TARDIS POWER IS OFF**
