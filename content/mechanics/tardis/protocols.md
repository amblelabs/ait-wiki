## Protocols are controls on the TARDIS console that function to make your playthrough easier, here they are explained out for you to better understand what function they serve when activated.

Protocols are controls on the TARDIS console that function to make your playthrough easier, 
here we have laid them out for you to better understand what function they serve when activated.

To locate where these controls are on the console, use the [**Sonic Screwdriver**](../../items/sonic)
while in scanning mode.

Hope this helps!

 # Protocol 1913 (AKA **Siege Mode**)
  
Siege Mode is a function on your TARDIS designed to keep the pilot safe, which should only be used as a last resort when all
else fails.<br> Siege Mode disables the TARDIS power and shrinks the exterior to a smaller and more protected version. As explained earlier
Siege Mode is designed to keep the pilot safe, and it completes this task by forcing the doors to be deadlock sealed and not allowing 
anyone in. Siege Mode requires fuel to be activated, if attempted to be activated without the necessary fuel it will fail.

Siege Mode does not drain any [Artron energy](../../mechanics/artron) while activated, this is because
all systems are powered down. Including **life support**. While in Siege Mode, the TARDIS will become extremely cold, and you will begin to
**freeze to death**, to combat this, leather armour is suggested to be worn while activated. 

As mentioned earlier, the TARDIS shrinks the exterior to a smaller and more protected version, this includes reducing its weight. The TARDIS
is now able to be picked up by any third-party who comes across it, this is why it is highly recommended to activate your TARDIS **handbrake** 
while Siege Mode is activated to prevent unwanted plyers handling your TARDIS.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT SEIGE MODE REQUIRES THE PLAYER TO HAVE INSTALLED THE DESPERATION CIRCUIT IN THE TARDIS ENGINE**
 
# Protocol 3 (AKA **Cloak Mode**)
Cloak Mode is a function on your TARDIS console designed to keep the TARDIS hidden when the chameleon circuit is faulty. Cloak Mode 
will render your TARDIS exterior invisible to the naked eye, and will reveal itself only when a pilot is holding a TARDIS key linked to the console.
When a pilot, holding a key, is within 5 metres of the exterior, the TARDIS will start to reveal itself. The closer the pilot approaches the exterior
the more the TARDIS will reveal itself.

Cloak Mode requires [Artron energy](../../mechanics/artron) to operate, make sure you have a hefty supply before
you activate this emergency protocol!

# Protocol 116 (AKA **Autopilot**)
Autopilot is a function on your TARDIS console designed for when there is less than the required pilots to navigate the time vortex. This protocol allows for automated navigation throughout the time vortex, but is programmed to take the safest route possible which is not always the shortest. This protocol takes extra [Artron energy](../../mechanics/artron) to operate so make sure you have enough fuel in your TARDIS before flight.

# Protocol 813 (AKA **Hail Mary**)
Hail Mary Mode is a function on your TARDIS console designed to rescue the pilot when in immediate danger of death. This protocol allows the TARDIS, when the handbrake is disabled, to rematerialise around the pilots position to rescue them from certain death.

Hail Mary Mode also requires [Artron energy](../../mechanics/artron) to operate, so make sure that the TARDIS has a healthy supply of fuel before activating this protocol.

# Protocol 19 (AKA **Isomorphic Security**)
On the console, find "Protocol 19" and use a key linked to the current TARDIS and click on the control. Once that's done, anyone that has a key linked to the current TARDIS can use the console, but anyone without a linked key cannot interact with the console at all, though via the security menu you're able to change what loyalty rank is required for players to interact with the console while P19 is active.

# Protocol 000 (AKA ***Self-Destruct***)
This is a special kind of protocol that cannot be triggerd via its own button, instead give the TARDIS a **Nether Star** via the telepathic circuits, this sends out the message "SELF DESTRUCT INITIATED ABORT SHIP" appear to anyone in the interior. Once everyone has vacated the interior the TARDIS deadlocks itself as the TARDIS star within goes supernova and blows up, resulting in a medium sized explosion where the TARDIS was.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS REQUIRES THE PLAYER TO HAVE PILOT LOYALTY**

{{< callout type="warning" >}} Once self destruct is enabled it cannot be stopped,so you better only let trustworthy people get inside your TARDIS, incase it is activated grab whatever you can from your interior. Once your TARDIS is destroyed it is not possible to retrieve destroyed items from it. {{< /callout >}}

# Protocol 515 (AKA Emergency Land / Artron Dump)
This protocol can be used for emergency escapes. How? It dumps all your artron and immediately travels to your destination, but (as a side effect) it does 1000 damage to each Circuit (aside from the Gravitational circuit).

# Protocol 54 (AKA Electric Discharge)
It produces an electric shock around the exterior, if someone is near the "electrocution zone", it gives them the following effects as a result;

* darkness
* slowness
* poison
* weakness
* hunger
* mining fatigue
