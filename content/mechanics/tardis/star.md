## What does it do?

Floats far below the TARDIS interior and spins at a slow pace. When **The TARDIS** is refueling the Ortu Solis's Rays begin pulsing.

If a player drops items into the Ortu Solis, they will be deposited back at the main door of the TARDIS

If a player falls into the Ortu Solis, they will be deposited back at the main door of the TARDIS

**NOTE: ORTU SOLIS GOES SUPER-NOVA DURING SECURITY PROTOCOL 000 (Self-Destruct). ALL ITEMS LEFT INSIDE THE INTERIOR OF THE TARDIS WILL BE DESTROYED** plus it's really gigantic :3
