title: Engine Phasing
---
## What IS Engine Phasing? 
Engine phasing is a negative consequence of your demat circuit having low durability, once the circuit reaches 300 durability (or less), engine phasing may randomly occur. If it does, the following things happen;

* TARDIS position randomized
* Causes the TARDIS to "Ghost Monument" (this can also "multi-phase" meaning it phases, goes on cooldown, and then phases again) 

## How do I counter this?

+ Turn power off
+ Keep circuit durability high
+ Use sonic on the exterior to cancel engine phasing
