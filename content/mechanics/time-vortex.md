* Some people have noted that they feel wierd after staring into the vortex for prolonged periods of times, but thats probably nothin.
* It also spins, the higher your throttle speed the faster it spins and when you are crashing.


* Here is a video made by tendo showing the vortex off,how to change it and such.
