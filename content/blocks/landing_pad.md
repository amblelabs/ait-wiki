## The Landing Pad
This is used to mark a chunk as a landing pad chunk.
<br>If you use the Sonic Screwdriver in scanning mode, it will show you the locations of each spot a TARDIS can land on, and you can move them with the sonic by clicking on the floor. Interacting with the Landing Pad block will give you a GUI to input a landing code that you can copy and put into your TARDIS' landing code in the Security Settings of your monitor.

Any TARDIS that attempts to land in a Landing Pad chunk will either be prevented from landing (if it doesn't have the proper landing code set), or be forced to land in one of the enabled spots in the chunk.
