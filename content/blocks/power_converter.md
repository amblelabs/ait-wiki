## How Is It Used?
The power converter acts as an alternative power source to the Console's refueler.
<br>It can convert Zeiton Shards, Zeiton Dust, fuel items & blocks (logs, coals and lava buckets), as well as the various Coral blocks into Artron energy for your TARDIS!
<br>Youâ€™ll have to link it up to the Engine via Artron Links (Artron Cables) for it to work.
