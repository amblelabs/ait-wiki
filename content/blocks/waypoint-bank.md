The Waypoint Bank is an easy way to fix your storage issues with waypoint cartridges.  
Just put them in and remotely activate them from anywhere in the **TARDIS**!

## How Do I Use the Waypoint Bank?

The Waypoint Bank has 16 slots, into which you can insert a [Waypoint Cartridge](https://amblelabs.github.io/ait-wiki/items/cartridge/) by interacting with (right-clicking) one of the free slots while holding a (non-empty) cartridge in your hand.

Here are all the ways to interact with the Waypoint Bank:

*   Get your waypoint cartridge and then simply `right-click` it onto a free slot to insert it.
    
*   Crouch and `right-click` a slot to pull a fully inserted cartridge half-way out. This will display the cartridge's info on the screen.
    
*   `Right-click` that same slot again to load the waypoint and set it as the new destination.
    
*   Crouch and `right-click` the slot of a half-way out cartridge to pull it fully out.
    
*   `Right-click` on a different slot to half-way pull out a different cartridge. (The previously half-way pulled out cartridge will be pushed back in.)
    
*   `Left-click` _anywhere_ on the lower block of the Waypoint bank to push the cartridge fully back in.
