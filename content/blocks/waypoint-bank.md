## How Do I Use the Waypoint Bank?

The Waypoint Bank has 16 slots, into which you can insert a [Waypoint Cartridge](../items/cartridge) by interacting with (right-clicking) one of the free slots while holding a (non-empty) cartridge in your hand.

Here are all the ways to interact with the Waypoint Bank:
* Get your waypoint cartridge and then simply `right-click` it onto a free slot to insert it.
* Crouch and `right-click` a slot to pull a fully inserted cartridge half-way out. This will display the cartridge's info on the screen.
* `Right-click` that same slot again to load the waypoint and set it as the new destination.
* Crouch and `right-click` the slot of a half-way out cartridge to pull it fully out.
* `Right-click` on a different slot to half-way pull out a different cartridge. (The previously half-way pulled out cartridge will be pushed back in.)
* `Left-click` *anywhere* on the lower block of the Waypoint bank to push the cartridge fully back in.
