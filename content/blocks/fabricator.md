## What Is the Fabricator?
A Fabricator is a machine capable of turning blueprints into usable items. Interacting with it while holding a blueprint in your hand will give it a recipe, and it will require you to input the items it displays in the center. ***Do note that required item amounts will vary, and the blueprint will not be used up.*** This also acts as a villager workbench, giving the villager the job of "Fabricator Engineer", who can provide components and blueprints for a small price.

## How Do I Get It To Work?
Look at the tooltip of the item (hover over it in your inventory). This applies to other items / blocks in the mod as well, although sometimes you might need to hold the shift key!

  You won't need JEI or anything, as the fabricator tells you what items you need. But JEI support MAY come in the future.
