## Why Is It So Big?
The Engine is organically based, just like the TARDIS it powers. It will grow depending on the amount and type of components you have connected to it.

## How Do I Use It?
You can place the Engine anywhere inside the TARDIS and attach components to it by using **Artron Cables** and [Generalized Subsystem Cores](./generalized_subsystem_core.md).
<br>The engine slowly loses durability when in use. Check out the [Durability](../mechanics/durability.md) page for how to repair it.

## How Do I Get It?
It can be crafted by using an engine blueprint on the **Fabricator** and then providing the required materials.
