## How Does This Work?

These are used to hold components to be attached to the engine via Artron Cables. While holding a component in hand, interact (right-click) with a Generalized Subsystem Core to install the component inside it, or sneak + interact one a core that already has a component to eject the component from it. (Or mine the core to have them both drop together.)
