      ## How Do I Use Them?


      Artron cables used to connect [Generalized Subsystem
      Cores](./generalized_subsystem_core.md) to the TARDIS' engine.  

      You don't need to connect every core separately. If core blocks are
      touching, they can be connected to the engine as one group.
